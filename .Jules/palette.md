## 2024-05-20 - Explicit Form Label Association
**Learning:** Relying solely on implicit association (wrapping inputs inside `<label>` tags) is suboptimal for screen reader accessibility. Explicit association using the `for` attribute pointing to the input `id` guarantees better compatibility across various assistive technologies.
**Action:** Always verify and enforce explicit `for` attributes on form labels during UX/accessibility reviews.
